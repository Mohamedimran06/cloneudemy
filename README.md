Udemy Clone — HTML & CSS

A simple, responsive front-end clone of Udemy built with only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript). This repository is intended for learning and portfolio purposes — it recreates the look-and-feel of an online course marketplace (landing page, course cards, navigation, footer, course detail mockup) using semantic markup and modern CSS techniques.

Features

Pixel-inspired landing page with hero, search, featured categories, and course cards

Course detail mockup (header, instructor info, syllabus preview)

Responsive layout (desktop → tablet → mobile) using CSS Grid & Flexbox

CSS-only interactions (hover states, simple card effects)

Clean, semantic HTML (accessible headings, alt text for images)

Easy to customize: colors, fonts, and layout variables centralized in CSS

Demo / Preview

Open index.html in your browser to view the landing page.

(Optional) Deploy to GitHub Pages by pushing the repo and enabling Pages in the repository settings.*
